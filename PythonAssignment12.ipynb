    "Ans 2) To get a Page object for page 5 from a PdfFileReader object in PyPDF2, you can use the getPage() method, which accepts a zero-based page number as an argument. So to get a Page object for page 5, which is the sixth page (since page numbers start at 0), you can use the following code:\n",

    "       The key difference between a Run object and a Paragraph object is that a Run object represents a single contiguous sequence of characters with a common set of formatting attributes, while a Paragraph object represents a block of text with a common set of formatting attributes.\n",
    "       For example, a paragraph might contain multiple sentences or multiple lines of text, but all of the text within the paragraph will have the same font size, font style, etc. In contrast, a run might represent a single word or phrase within the paragraph that is formatted differently from the rest of the text, such as being bolded or italicized.\n",
