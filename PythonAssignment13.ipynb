    "##### 1. What advantages do Excel spreadsheets have over CSV spreadsheets?\n",
    "Ans 1) Excel spreadsheets have several advantages over CSV (Comma Separated Value) spreadsheets:\n",
    "\n",
    "Formatting: Excel allows you to apply formatting such as fonts, colors, borders, and alignment to the data in the spreadsheet. This makes it easier to read and interpret the data, and can also make the spreadsheet look more professional.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formulas and Functions: Excel allows you to perform calculations on the data using built-in formulas and functions. This can be useful for performing complex calculations or for analyzing large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Charts and Graphs: Excel allows you to create charts and graphs from the data in the spreadsheet. This can be useful for visualizing trends or patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Validation: Excel allows you to apply data validation rules to the data in the spreadsheet. This can help to ensure that the data is entered correctly and can also help to prevent errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Filtering and Sorting: Excel allows you to filter and sort the data in the spreadsheet. This can be useful for quickly finding specific data or for organizing the data in a specific way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaboration: Excel allows multiple users to work on the same spreadsheet at the same time. This can be useful for teams or organizations that need to collaborate on data.\n",

    "##### 2.What do you pass to csv.reader() and csv.writer() to create reader and writer objects?\n",
    "Ans 2) To create reader and writer objects using the csv module in Python, we need to pass a file object to the csv.reader() and csv.writer() functions.\n",

    "##### 3. What modes do File objects for reader and writer objects need to be opened in?\n",
    "Ans 3) When creating reader and writer objects using the csv module in Python, you need to open the file in the appropriate mode depending on whether you are reading from or writing to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a reader object, you need to open the file in read mode ('r'). This is because the reader object reads data from the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a writer object, you need to open the file in write mode ('w'). This is because the writer object writes data to the file."
