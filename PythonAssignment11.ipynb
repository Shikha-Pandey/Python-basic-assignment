    "#### 9. What are the differences between the Step Over, Step In, and Step Out buttons in the debugger?\n",
    "Ans 9) The Step Over, Step In, and Step Out buttons in the debugger are used to control the flow of execution of your code during debugging. Here are the differences between these three buttons:\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Step Over (or Next): This button allows you to execute the next line of code and move the debugger to the next line, without stepping into any functions or subroutines. If the current line of code contains a function call, that function will be executed, but the debugger will not enter the function and will return to the calling line after the function has completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Step In (or Step): This button allows you to step into the next function call, and execute the code inside that function. If the current line of code does not contain a function call, this button behaves the same as the Step Over button. Once you enter the function, you can use the Step Over and Step Out buttons to control execution within the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Step Out: This button allows you to step out of the current function and return to the calling line, executing all remaining lines in the function without stopping. This button is useful if you have stepped into a function and want to quickly return to the calling code, without executing every line of the function\n",

    "#### 10.After you click Continue, when will the debugger stop ?\n",
    "Ans 10)  when you click the Continue button in the debugger, the debugger will continue running your code until it encounters a breakpoint, an unhandled exception, or the program completes execution. This allows you to step through your code and debug any issues that arise, while also allowing your code to run uninterrupted for normal program execution.\n"

    "#### 11. What is the concept of a breakpoint?\n",
    "Ans 11) A breakpoint is a tool used in debugging to pause the execution of code at a specific line, allowing the programmer to examine the program's state at that point. Breakpoints are useful for isolating issues, gaining a better understanding of the flow of control, and setting conditional or trace breakpoints. Most modern IDEs and debuggers provide an interface for setting and managing breakpoints."
